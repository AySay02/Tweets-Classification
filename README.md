# Tweets-Classification
> RNN models to classify whether a tweet indicates some disaster or attack news or is it just a normal tweet.\
> To classify only those tweets that show critical world news - Data can be modified for their own classification between different tweets.\
> Different types of RNN models for comparing accuracies, precisions, recalls and F1-scores are used like 1D Convolutional NN, LSTM layers, GRU-powered RNN, Bidirectional RNN, transfer learning, and TF-IDF Naive Bayes classifier to get a base case measurements.
